# entity template
A template is a descriptor of an entity archetype. It allows specification of components as well as the properties of components
either as raw values, or value factories. A value factory is a function (optionally parameterized) that generates values.
Templates should be composable. 

A sample template:
```yaml
components:
  - type: Health
    properties:
      current: 10
      max: 10
  - type: Name
    properties:
      given: !Fn.randomName()
      surname: !Fn.randomFamilyName()
mixin:
  - mobs/ghost.yml
  - ai/patrol.yml 
```

# performing unions on sets
if we used components as sets and did set operations to get lists of entities that was the result

# ECS Loop optimization idea
What if we could reduce the number of entity traversals to 1?
* system.update passed iterator that gives them a chance to subscribe to the next iteration
* iterator.each(filter, callback);// call callback on each entity matching filter
* iterator.collect(filter, callback); // call callback w/ set of entities matching filter
* iterator executes, looping through all entities and calling `each` callbacks on entities matching registered filters, 
  or collecting entities matching registered filters and passing the set to the `collect` callback?
  
```
// if your system can operate on one entity at a time
class FooBarSystem extends ApeECS.System {
    update(delta, iterator) {
        iterator.each({all:['ComponentA', 'ComponentB']}, entity => {
            let a = entity.getOne('ComponentA');
            let b = entity.getOne('ComponentB');
            a.foo = 'bar';
            a.update();
            b.biz = 'buz';
            b.update();
        });
    }
}

// if your system needs to work on the set of entities (for cross comparisons, etc)
class ColliderSystem extends ApeECS.System {
    update(delta, iterator) {
        iterator.collect({all:['Collider', 'Position']}, entities => {
            // do collision checks between entities
        });
    }
}
```
